Silent Orbit is a 2D platformer game built with Three.js


## Run the Game
Download the source, and run `Server.jar` and open `localhost:[port number from GUI]/index.html`

By default the port is `8080`, so you would go to `localhost:8080/index.html` to load the project

This assumes you have `Java 11` at minimum installed on your computer. 

## How to Play
Use the arrow keys to move around the level
